The comment box is using [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/). This is a demo configuration in the `config.yaml` file.

```yaml
utterances: # comment system: utterances (https://utteranc.es/) parameters
    repo: "kausalflow/hugo-connectome-theme-demo"  # repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]", the comments will appear as issues in this repository on github.
    term: pathname               # issue-term="pathname"
    theme: github-light          # theme="github-light"
```
